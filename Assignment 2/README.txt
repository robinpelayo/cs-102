Robin Pelayo - Instructions for Assignment2:
STEP 1:
Open files in jGrasp.
STEP 2:
Click run.
STEP 3:
The program will have loaded all the input data from the 
file. This means that at this point the database should not be empty.
To insert a new tennis player simply enter all of the necessary information in the text boxes and click add. 
To remove a player enter the player's id and click remove, this does not remove all of the matches the player has played.
To export the database to a .txt file simply click the export button and the program will export the database to a file names export.txt
To reset the database simply click reset
To import back from the file simply click import from file and it will import the data from the file "export.txt". 
Note: When importing and exporting database the parts of the date will occasionally be lost.

Lastly, I chose to implement the ArrayList java class instead of Vector, LinkedList, ArrayDeque, and Stack because
I have used ArrayList in the past in my AP Computer Science class in high school. I did not use Vector because I was not 
well versed with the methods in the class. I did not use LinkedList because I felt I had enough expereince with LinkedLists 
from assignment 1. I did not use ArrayDeque because I had never heard of the class before this project. Finally, I did not use 
Stack because I did not know many methods in this class.
